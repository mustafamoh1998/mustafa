<h3>The twentieth century witnessed a tremendous development in various fields of cultural, social and technological life, so there was a need to establish a specialized university that includes only engineering and scientific departments. Therefore, the <mark>University of Technology</mark> was established in 1975 to keep pace with the scientific development witnessed by the world, as the university became a scientific, intellectual and cultural platform that supports the Iraqi society. The university now includes 13 engineering and scientific departments, 8 centers, in addition to a consulting office that includes several disciplines.The university started its march with steady steps and scientific achievements. Where the origin of the university goes back to 1960, when the idea of ​​establishing (the Institute for the Number of Industrial Teachers) was received by the Ministry of Education in cooperation with the UNESCO, and engineer Jassem Shehab Al-Hayani was the director and founder of the institute, and the establishment of the institute was announced on January 22, 1960, and the study period was set at five years. After high school, the graduate is awarded a degree For the Bachelor of Applied Engineering, 45 students, all of them males from industrial secondary schools, were accepted in the first meal. Since its establishment, the goals of this institute have been determined by the number of applied engineers who are needed by laboratories and engineering projects, and the preparation of technical teachers for the purpose of teaching in industrial and vocational schools. The institute has the approval of the Minister of Education. </h3></div>
